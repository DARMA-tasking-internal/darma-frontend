\chapter{Evolution of the Specification}
\label{chap:evolution}
\section{Specification History}
\label{sec:past}
Version 0.1 of the specification existed in \gls{API} form only, and was not
formally documented.  In this version of the specification:
\begin{compactenum}
\item all input and output dependencies had to be explicitly enumerated by the application
developer;
\item all input and outputs were to each task were declared using \gls{coordination semantics}
\item explicit versioning of inputs/outputs was required to keep data
logically distinct;
\item Sequential ordering of statements within DARMA has no significance for task ordering
\end{compactenum}

 Application developer concerns regarding version 0.1 of the specification
 centered around the 1) verbosity of the approach, 2) the difficulty of
 reasoning about correct program order of tasks, and 3) the fact that 
 \inlinecode{create_work} cannot be called
 within the scope of class instance member functions.  The first two of these issues are
   addressed in version 0.2 of the specification, and the third concern will be
   addressed in later releases of the specification.
   


\section{New Features in 0.2}
\label{sec:current}
In version 0.2 of the specification we:
  \begin{compactenum}
\item leverage the \CC\ \gls{capture} and
    \gls{introspection} mechanisms to minimize verbosity of the \gls{front end}
    \gls{API};  
\item enforce \gls{sequential semantics} within a \gls{rank} to
    facilitate reasoning about program order; 
\item introduce the use of
    \glspl{handle} variables to access data in the \gls{key-value store} to limit number of key-value operations for often-used data
\item implicit versioning within a task/scope based on sequential program order    
    \end{compactenum}


\section{Planned Features in Future Releases}
\label{sec:future}
\todo[inline]{Make sure list is accurate - change releases if necessary, add missing
  things}

As part of the \gls{co-design} process, this specification will evolve quickly.
  Based on feedback thus far, there are already
many additional features planned for future incarnations of the specification that
will be released this calendar year (2016).  These are summarized below:

\begin{compactdesc}
\item[0.3:]
\begin{compactitem}
\item support for create works within functors 
\item hierarchical \glspl{dependency} (e.g., classes that have dependencies as
    member variables)
\item task creation within class member functions
\item support for automatic data partitions and collectives
\end{compactitem}
\item[0.4:]
\begin{compactitem}
\item Full support for classes in an actor-model mode \todo[inline]{I don't know what this means - elaborate on this,
add details regarding migratability tradeoffs}
\end{compactitem}
\item[0.5:]
\begin{compactitem}
\item Include support for expression of \inlinecode{execution space} and \inlinecode{memory space}.
\item Custom data models supporting arbitrary data slicing/interference tests
\end{compactitem}
\end{compactdesc}
