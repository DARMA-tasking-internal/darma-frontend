\section{Programming Model}
\label{sec:programming_model}
In DARMA \gls{spmd} is the dominant parallelism and the notion of a \gls{rank}
is maintained within the \gls{API}.   
  The DARMA \gls{API} simplifies the introduction
  of asynchronous task parallelism via the use of standard \CC\ constructs, such
  as \gls{reference counted pointers} and \glspl{lambda}.

  
The \gls{API} is being \gls{co-design}ed with application developers
and computer scientists whose knowledge spans the entire runtime software stack.
Current applications affecting the design include portions of the \gls{Trilinos} software stack
and \gls{ASC} \gls{ATDM} efforts at Sandia National Laboratories. 
 
% NOTE: this is morphed text from open mp/ocr specs.  is this needed?
%This specification covers user-directed parallelization, where the user
%has annotated that portions of the work could be performed asynchronously.
%The DARMA runtime will schedule all asynchronous work in a \gls{deferred} fashion,
%checking that all \gls{input dependencies} are met prior to performing work.  
%The user is responsible for ensuring that the application using the DARMA
%\gls{API} constructs executes correctly.
