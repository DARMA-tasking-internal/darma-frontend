\chapter{Rules for Making Flows}
To better illustrate when particular \inlinecode{make_X_flow} functions are called
and which Uses they belong to, we provide an illustrative set of code samples.
We denote permissions as scheduling/immediate e.g. Modify/Read means scheduling privileges of Modify,
immediate privileges of Read.  We also indicate the Use object associated with a handle as Use(x,y)
where x and y label the input and output Flow of the Use.

\section{Modify Capture with Immediate-Modify Permissions}
Consider the following code:
\begin{CppCode}
auto handle = initial_access<T>(...);
...
//handle has Use(a,b) and Modify/Modify privileges
create_work([=]{ //modify capture
  //handle has Use(c,d)
})
//handle has Use(e,f)
\end{CppCode}
In the code sample above, the Flow objects were created as follows:

\begin{CppCode}
c = make_forwarding_flow(a, ForwardingChanges);
d = make_next_flow(c, Output);
e = make_same_flow(d, Input);
f = make_same_flow(b, Output);
\end{CppCode}

\section{Modify Capture without Immediate Privileges}
\begin{CppCode}
auto handle = initial_access<T>(...);
...
//handle has Use(a,b) and Modify/None privileges
create_work([=]{ //modify capture
  //handle has Use(c,d)
})
//handle has Use(e,f)
\end{CppCode}
In the code sample above, the Flow objects were created as follows:

\begin{CppCode}
c = make_same_flow(a, Input);
d = make_next_flow(c, Output);
e = make_same_flow(d, Input);
f = make_same_flow(b, Output);
\end{CppCode}

\section{Read Capture with Immediate Modify Privileges}
\begin{CppCode}
auto handle = initial_access<T>(...);
...
//handle has Use(a,b) and Modify/Modify privileges
create_work([=]{ //read capture
  //handle has Use(c,d)
})
//handle has Use(e,f) and Modify/Read privileges
\end{CppCode}
In the code sample above, the Flow objects were created as follows:

\begin{CppCode}
c = make_forwarding_flow(a, ForwardingChanges);
d = make_same_flow(c, OutputFlowOfReadOperation);
e = make_same_flow(c, Input);
f = make_same_flow(b, Output);
\end{CppCode}

\section{Read Capture with Immediate Read Privileges}
\begin{CppCode}
auto handle = initial_access<T>(...);
...
//handle has Use(a,b) and Read/Read privileges
create_work([=]{ //read capture
  //handle has Use(c,d)
})
//handle has Use(a,b) and Read/Read privileges
\end{CppCode}
In the code sample above, the Flow objects were created as follows:

\begin{CppCode}
c = make_same_flow(a, Input);
d = make_same_flow(c, OutputFlowOfReadOperation);
\end{CppCode}
In contrast to previous cases, the newly created task does not create a new Use for the continuing context.
The previous Use is considered to have continued.
