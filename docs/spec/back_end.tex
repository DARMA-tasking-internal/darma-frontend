\chapter{Back End}
\label{chap:back_end}

The back end API is organized into two namespaces:
\begin{compactenum}
\item {\ttfamily darma\_runtime::abstract::frontend} 
\item {\ttfamily darma\_runtime::abstract::backend}  
\end{compactenum}

The first contains
abstraction base classes of entities that are implemented in the translation
layer and are the only constructs in that layer that the backend is
allowed to interact with.  The second contains abstract base classes that must be concretely implemented in the backend and
are the only backend abstractions the translation layer is allowed to interact
with.  Below is a summary of the requirements to implement these abstractions,
the documentation for which is taken from the Doxygen-style comments in
the source code itself.  As such, the source code may be a better resource for
those interested in this part of the document, but we have included it here for
completeness. \todo{DAVID: add coments here about key and version going away}
