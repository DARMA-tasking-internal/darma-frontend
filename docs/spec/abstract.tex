In this document, we provide the specification for DARMA,
a co-design research vehicle for \gls{AMT} programming models and runtime
systems.  This specification serves to facilitate three primary activities: 
1) gathering and communicating application requirements, 2) exploring AMT
design space tradeoffs, and 3) communication between the AMT community and
other computer science research communities.
The DARMA code base comprises three main layers: the \gls{front end} \gls{API},
\gls{translation layer}, and
\gls{back end} \gls{API}.  
The \gls{front end} is the user-level \gls{API}. 
Its use has the feel of an \gls{EDSL} in \CC,  inheriting the generic
language constructs of \CC and adding \gls{semantics} that facilitate
distributed parallel programming.  Though the \gls{front end} \gls{EDSL} uses
\CC constructs in non-traditional ways to implement these semantics, it is
nonetheless fully embedded in the \CC language. As such, it will compile with any
\CC compiler supporting the \CC11 standard with a small subset of \CC14
required for advanced features (\inlinecode{gcc >= 4.8, clang >= 3.5}).  
The \gls{translation layer} leverages \CC\ \gls{template
metaprogramming} to map the user's code onto the \gls{back end} \gls{API}.
The \gls{back end} \gls{API} is a set of abstract classes and function
signatures that runtime system developers must implement in accordance with the
specification requirements in order to interface with application code written
to the DARMA front end.  
Each of these three layers is described herein. We also
inlcude a list of application requirements driving the specification (along
with a list of the applications contributing to the requirements to date), and
conclude this document with a brief history of changes between previous
versions of the specificaiton, and a summary of the planned changes in upcoming
versions of the specification.
