\section{Compatible Data Models}
\label{sec:data_model}


DARMA provides a flexible data model (DARMA is only aware of tuple or key identifiers for a coarse-grained data block).
This leaves the application developer free to use arbitrary data structures, but puts more responsibility on application developer to define serialization, \gls{slicing}, and \glspl{interference test} 
for data blocks. 
\todo[inline]{add details here}
