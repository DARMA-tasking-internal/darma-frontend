\section{Compatible Data Models}
\label{sec:datamodel}
\gls{DARMA} supports \gls{data-flow dependency} management, and consequently
must have some knowledge of the structure of application data in order to make
effective, efficient runtime dependency management and data staging decisions.  Rather
than impose a \gls{data model} directly, \gls{DARMA} leaves the application
developer free to use arbitrary data structures.  This means the application
developer must define \gls{serialization}, \gls{slicing}, and \glspl{interference test} for 
their data (i.e., this information cannot be directly inferred due to the lack
of \gls{data model}).
