                  auto-tuners and domain-specific languages, rely on
                  generative programming techniques to achieve high
                  performance and portability. However, these systems
                  are often implemented in multiple disparate
                  languages and perform code generation in a separate
                  process from program execution, making certain
                  optimizations difficult to engineer. We leverage a
                  popular scripting language, Lua, to stage the
                  execution of a novel low-level language,
                  Terra. Users can implement optimizations in the
                  high-level language, and use built-in constructs to
                  generate and execute high-performance Terra code. To
                  simplify meta-programming, Lua and Terra share the
                  same lexical environment, but, to ensure
                  performance, Terra code can execute independently of
                  Lua's runtime. We evaluate our design by
                  reimplementing existing multi-language systems
                  entirely in Terra. Our Terra-based auto-tuner for
                  BLAS routines performs within 20\% of ATLAS, and our
                  DSL for stencil computations runs 2.3x faster than
                  hand-written C.",

                  visual problem solving environment (PSE) that is
                  designed to specifically address the unique problems
                  of massively parallel computation on terascale
                  computing platforms. Uintah supports the entire life
                  cycle of scientific applications by allowing
                  scientific programmers to quickly and easily develop
                  new techniques, debug new implementations, and apply
                  known algorithms to solve novel problems. Uintah is
                  built on three principles: 1) As much as possible,
                  the complexities of parallel execution should be
                  handled for the scientist, 2) software should be
                  reusable at the component level, and 3) scientists
                  should be able to dynamically steer and visualize
                  their simulation results as the simulation
                  executes. To provide this functionality, Uintah
                  builds upon the best features of the SCIRun PSE and
                  the DOE Common Component Architecture (CCA).",
