\subsection{\texttt{publish}}
\label{ssec:api_fe_publish}

\paragraph{Summary} \mbox{}\\
\codetarget{publish} the data pointed to by a given \gls{handle} so that it can be retrieved on 
other \gls{DARMA} \glspl{rank}.

\paragraph{Syntax} \mbox{}\\
\begin{CppCode}
void
AccessHandle<T>::publish(n_readers=..., version=...)
\end{CppCode}

\paragraph{Positional Arguments} \mbox{}\\
None.

\paragraph{Keyword Arguments} \mbox{}\\
\begin{compactitem}
\item |n_readers=size_t| (optional): informs the \gls{runtime system} how many times
\codelink{read_access} will be called in order to access this data.
If omitted, it defaults to 1.
\item |version=KeyExpression| (or |version(KeyExpression...)|,
  see \S~\ref{sec:keyword} for multiple-right-hand-side \gls{keyword argument} usage)
(optional):
informs the \gls{runtime system} what version to associate with the data being published. 
The value can be an arbitrary |KeyExpression|.
If omitted, the version defaults to an empty \codelink{key} (i.e., a
\codelink{key} \gls{tuple} with zero 
components).  Omitting this keyword implicitly indicates to the \gls{runtime
system} that the \gls{handle} (or any \gls{handle} with the same name
\codelink{key}) will not be published
again in the remaining lifetime of the program.
\end{compactitem}

\paragraph{Details} \mbox{}\\
Publish the data associated with a given \gls{handle} |h| such that it can be
retrieved \codelink{n_readers} times anywhere via a \codelink{read_access} invocation
that gives the same name key as |h| and the same \codelink{version}
\codelink{key} as the one given to the \gls{keyword argument} to \codelink{publish}.
A \codelink{publish} is a {\it read-only capture} operation (see
\S~\ref{sec:handlerules}).

\paragraph{Code Snippet} \mbox{}\\
\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{CppCodeNumb}
auto me = darma_spmd_rank();
assert(darma_spmd_size() >= 2);
if(me == 0) {
  auto my_handle = initial_access<double>("key_1");
  create_work([=]{
    my_handle.emplace_value(5.3);
  });
  my_handle.publish(n_readers=1, version="only");
}
else if(me == 1) {
  auto my_handle = read_access<double>("key_1", version="only");
  create_work([=]{
    cout << my_handle.get_value() << endl; // prints "5.3"
  });
}
\end{CppCodeNumb}

\paragraph{Restrictions and Pitfalls}\mbox{}\\
\begin{compactitem}
\item \codelink{publish} puts more burden on the programmer to avoid race conditions and deadlock, 
  which are automatically avoided when relying entirely on \gls{sequential
  semantics}.  This is similar to deadlock situations with sends and receives in MPI in 
  which communicating processes block on a receive before sending to each other.  
  For instance, the following snippet deadlocks:
  %\begin{center}
  \begin{CppCode}
// This code deadlocks!
auto me = darma_spmd_rank();
assert(darma_spmd_size() >= 2);
if(me == 0) {
  auto h1 = initial_access<int>("key", 0);
  auto h2 = read_access<int>("key", 1);
  create_work([=]{ 
    h1.set_value(42);
    h1.publish();
    cout << h2.get_value() << endl;
  }); 
}
else if (me == 1) {
  auto h3 = initial_access<int>("key", 1);
  auto h4 = read_access<int>("key", 0);
  create_work([=]{ 
    h3.set_value(73);
    h3.publish();
    cout << h4.get_value() << endl; 
  }); 
}
// Deadlock! (eventually, at the latest when darma_finalize() is
// called): neither of the above create_work()s can ever run
  \end{CppCode}
  This snippet deadlocks because a dependency loop has been created between two
  \codelink{publish}/\codelink{read_access} pairs. While the deadlock is
  relatively obvious here, it can be much more difficult to decipher in a more
  complex code, especially if, for instance, |h1| and |h2| are
  arguments to a function, or if the parts of the \codelink{key}s used to construct the
  \glspl{handle} are variables with values dependent on some previous computation.
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item It is particularly easy to create deadlock scenarios by publishing a
    \gls{handle} and fetching it within the same \gls{rank}.  For this reason, we recommend
  extreme caution when this scenario could arise, and in general we suggest that
  the user should avoid doing so if at all possible.
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Since \codelink{publish} is a {\it read-only capture} operation, it must
  have \gls{scheduling permissions} of {\it Read} or {\it Modify}; calling
  \codelink{publish} on a \gls{handle} with other \gls{scheduling permissions} is a runtime error.  Also, as with
  all {\it read-only capture} operations, calling \codelink{publish} on a
  \gls{handle} with {\it Modify} \gls{immediate permissions} results in a
  \gls{handle} with {\it Read} \gls{immediate permissions} in the
  \gls{continuing context}.  See
  \S~\ref{sec:handlerules} for more details.  For example, the following code
  results in a runtime error at the marked line:
%\begin{minipage}[t]{0.95\linewidth}%
%  \centering
  \begin{CppCode}
  auto h = initial_access<int>("key");
  create_work([=]{
    h.set_value(5);
    h.publish();
    h.set_value(10); // $\no$ h does not have Modify immediate permissions
  });
  \end{CppCode}
%\end{minipage}
\item It is an error to call \codelink{publish} on a \gls{handle} with the same 
  codlink{key} and \codelink{version} more than once.
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item If \codelink{publish} is called on a given \gls{handle} without the
  \codelink{version} \gls{keyword argument}, it is an error to call \codelink{publish}
  again on that \gls{handle} or any other \gls{handle} with the same name
  \codelink{key} for the
  remaining lifetime of the program.  Note that because of the default behavior
  of the \codelink{version} \gls{keyword argument}, giving an explicit
  \codelink{version} that is
  the empty \codelink{key} (e.g., |h.publish(version())| or
  |h.publish(version=make_key())|) will lead to this same behavior.
