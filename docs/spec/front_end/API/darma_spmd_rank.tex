\subsection{\texttt{darma\_spmd\_rank}}

\paragraph{Summary}\mbox{}\\
Returns the rank index associated with the opaque rank context from which this
function was invoked.

\paragraph{Syntax}\mbox{}\\
\begin{CppCode}
/* unspecified */ darma_runtime::darma_spmd_rank();
\end{CppCode}

\paragraph{Positional Arguments} \mbox{}\\
None. 

\paragraph{Output}\mbox{}\\
An object of unspecified type that may be treated as a |std::size_t|
which is less than the value returned by |darma_spmd_size()|.

\paragraph{Details}\mbox{}\\
This function returns the rank index of the calling DARMA rank.  (Recall that a
rank is the opaque context between the invocation of |darma_init| and
a corresponding invocation of |darma_finalize|).  If the value returned
by |darma_spmd_size| is convertible to a |std::size_t| with the
value $N$, then the value returned by this function will be convertible to a
|std::size_t| with the value $r$, which will always satisfy $0 <=
r < N$.  Furthermore, the type of the value returned by this function will
always be directly comparable to the type returned by |darma_spmd_size|
and to $0$ such that this previous condition is met.  The value returned is also
equality comparable with $0$, the value returned will be true for equality
comparison with $0$ on exactly one rank.  The value returned by this function
will be unique on every rank (in the equality sense), and will be the same
across multiple invocations of the function within a given rank.  The value
returned will also be the same at any asynchronous work invocation depth within
a rank's opaque context, regardless of whether that work gets stolen or
migrated.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{CppCodeNumb}
#include <darma.h>
int darma_main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  using namespace darma_runtime;
  darma_init(argc, argv);

  // get my rank
  const size_t myRank = darma_spmd_rank();
  // get size 
  const size_t size = darma_spmd_size();

  std::cout << "Rank " << myRank << "/" << size << std::endl;

  darma_finalize();
  return 0;
