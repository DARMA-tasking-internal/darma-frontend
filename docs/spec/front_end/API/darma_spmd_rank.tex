\subsection{\texttt{darma\_spmd\_rank}}

\paragraph{Summary}\mbox{}\\
\codetarget{darma_spmd_rank} returns the \gls{rank} index associated with the
\gls{execution stream} from which this function was invoked.

\paragraph{Syntax}\mbox{}\\
\begin{CppCode}
/* unspecified */ darma_runtime::darma_spmd_rank();
\end{CppCode}

\paragraph{Positional Arguments} \mbox{}\\
None. 

\paragraph{Output}\mbox{}\\
An object of unspecified type that may be treated as a \inlinecode{std::size_t}
which is less than the value returned by \codelink{darma_spmd_size}.

\paragraph{Details}\mbox{}\\
This function returns the \gls{rank} index of the calling \gls{DARMA} \gls{execution
stream}.  If the value returned
by \codelink{darma_spmd_size} is convertible to a \inlinecode{std::size_t} with the
value $N$, then the value returned by this function will be convertible to a
\inlinecode{std::size_t} with the value $r$, which will always satisfy $0 <=
r < N$.  Furthermore, the type of the value returned by this function will
always be directly comparable to the type returned by \codelink{darma_spmd_size}
and to $0$ such that this previous condition is met.  The value returned is also
equality comparable with $0$, the value returned will be true for equality
comparison with $0$ on exactly one rank.  The value returned by this function
will be unique on every \gls{rank} (in the equality sense), and will be the same
across multiple invocations of the function within a given \gls{rank}.  The value
returned will also be the same at any asynchronous work invocation depth within
a \gls{rank}'s \gls{execution stream}, regardless of whether that work gets stolen or
migrated.

\begin{CppCodeNumb}
#include <darma.h>
int darma_main(int argc, char** argv)

  // get my rank

  // get size 
  const size_t size = darma_spmd_size();

  std::cout << "Rank " << myRank << "/" << size << std::endl;
