\subsection{\texttt{operator->}}

\paragraph{Summary}\mbox{}\\
A dereference operator to directly access the object 
pointed to by the handle.

\paragraph{Syntax}\mbox{}\\
\begin{CppCode}
T* AccessHandle<T>::operator->();
\end{CppCode}

\paragraph{Input Parameters}\mbox{}\\
None.

\paragraph{Return}\mbox{}\\
Returns a reference to the data pointed to by the handle.

\paragraph{Details}\mbox{}\\
Just like |set_value| and |get_reference|, this operator
requires {\it Modify} immediate permissions to invoke safely.  Unlike 
|set_value| and |get_reference|, however, the arrow operator can
also be invoked on handles that only have {\it Read} immediate permissions.  In
that case, it is up to the user to ensure that only |const| methods are
called on the resulting object.  In other words,
|AccessHandle<T>::operator->()| lets you ``shoot yourself in the foot.''
If more safety is desired, use the more  verbose forms with
|set_value()| and |get_reference()|.
