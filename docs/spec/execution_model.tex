\section{Compatible Execution Models}
\label{sec:execmodel}
\gls{DARMA} supports \gls{phased execution} models, rather than \gls{conservative
execution} models.  
An initial \gls{spmd} launch of an algorithm must be supported, and if
no imbalances are present, the \gls{runtime system} implementation should
maintain an optimal initial decomposition. In addition to the coarse-grained distributed
\gls{data parallelism} specified by the \gls{spmd} launch, additional \gls{task
parallelism} and \gls{pipeline parallelism} are introduced via the \CC-embedded task annotations.
As part of the \gls{AMT} design space exploration, we are working with
\gls{runtime system} teams to develop \gls{DARMA}-compliant \glspl{back end}
implementations that utilize existing \gls{AMT} technologies with different
underlying \glspl{execution model} (e.g., \gls{actor model}, \gls{event-based}).  


Although not yet supported in version \specVersion\ of the specification, several
important features will play a role in the DARMA \gls{execution model}:
