The contents of the tinympl directory have been adapted/extended/forked
from the tinympl project, forked from http://sbabbi.github.io/tinympl
on 2015-12-17.  The tinympl project appears to be no longer maintained,
and thus we are forking a copy of it into DHARMA.  The original files
contained the following header:

```c++
// Copyright (C) 2013, Ennio Barbaro.

// Use, modification, and distribution is subject to the Boost Software
// License, Version 1.0. (See accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at

//
// See http://sbabbi.github.io/tinympl for documentation.
//
// You are welcome to contact the author at:

```

The copyright has been incorporated into the new header, which includes 
DHARMA's own copyright and license requirements.  All of this is legal under
the terms of the original tinympl license, which is included in 
`ORIGINAL_TINYMPL_LICENSE.txt`.
