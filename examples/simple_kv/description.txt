Two simple examples to illustrate how data pieces are associated with keys, 
how they are published and fetched by transacting with the kv store.

The serial example declares a handle to a float that is initial_access
(meaning data with that key does not exist anywhere in the system yet).
A value for the float then set via this handle, and this is published.
The publish statement is provided the information that this piece of 
data will only ever be read once.
The same float is then read by a different handle, which is designated
as read access, and this value is printed to screen.

The parallel example is a slight variation on the serial example. Here
each rank declares an initial access float handle, sets a value via the
handle, and then publishes that but this time designated as to be read 
by two readers. The setting of the float value is wrapped inside a task
this time. Then, each rank creates a second task, which declares two 
read access float handles for reading the float values published by the
left and right neighbours.
