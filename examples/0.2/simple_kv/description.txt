The parallel example is a slight variation on the serial example. Here
each rank declares an initial access float handle, sets a value via the
handle, and then publishes that but this time designated as to be read 
by two readers. The setting of the float value is wrapped inside a task
this time. Then, each rank creates a second task, which declares two 
read access float handles for reading the float values published by the
left and right neighbours.
