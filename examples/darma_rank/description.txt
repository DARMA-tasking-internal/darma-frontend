This test simply initializes the DARMA environment. 
Each process retrieves the corresponding rank and the size of the environment. 
Each process then prints the value of its rank.

A DARMA rank should be thought as equivalent to an MPI rank with one difference.
The difference is that the data/label created by a DARMA rank does not necessarily 
stay associated with that rank, but can be migrated elsewhere during runtime.
