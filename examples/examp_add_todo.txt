Meeting Feb. 2nd: Janine, Hemanth, Francesco 


Examples to create:

- 	clarifying dharma rank and mpi rank (example): (me) 

- 	keyvalues store and publishing, fetching. (Hemanth)
	NO CREATE work, just syntax of keyvalues  
 	* initial_access, read_access 
 	* serial version 
 	* parallel version and baseline MPI for comparison 

- 	create_work (many examples)
	* base hello world (me)
	* fibonacci (nested create work, recursive) (Hemanth)
	* one with collectives (ping Jeremy for this)
	* collective dot product, independently me and Hemanth, lets see how different
	  imagine what API would looks like, how to express collective call from user perspective
	* multiple tasks acting on same object but different data members (Hemanth)

	* example highlighting what sequential semantics (Hemanth)
	* example subcribe (2.1), possibly simplified version of 1d stencil (me)
	* document 1d stencil (first attempt, all)
