By default, frontend tests are disabled.  To simply install the
frontend headers, execute:

$ cmake ${source} \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${frontend_prefix}
$ make install

where ${frontend_prefix} is the location you want the headers
installed.

To enable the frontend tests, do the following instead:

$ cmake ${source} \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${frontend_prefix} \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${cxxcompiler} \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${ccompiler} \
  -DDARMA_FE_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \
  -DGTEST_DIR=${gtest_install_prefix}
$ make
$ ctest
$ make install

Here, ${ccompiler} is the desired c compiler, ${cxxcompiler} is the
desired C++ compiler, and ${gtest_install_prefix} is the prefix of
a previous googletest/googlemock install.

If you omit the CMAKE_C_COMPILER and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER options,
${CC} and ${CXX} will be used by cmake.

The frontend tests require the DEVELOPMENT version googletest/
googlemock.  Release 1.7.0 is NOT sufficient.  If the install prefix
is in the default location, you may able able to omit -DGTEST_DIR
entirely.
