To build a DARMA program, you must do the following:

1) Install the DARMA front-end header-only library
2) Build a backend runtime library, pointing at the header install in #1
3) Build an actual application, including the frontend/backend headers 
   and linking to the library built in #2

For debugging purposes, this repo includes the complete front-end
as well as some very simple backends along with some simple examples.

===========================================================================

To do an all-in-one build of the frontend, the reference threads backend,
and the examples, configure CMake with:

cmake ${source} \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${prefix} \
  -DTHREADS_BACKEND=On

===========================================================================

If building components individually, do the following:

1) To install the frontend (header-only):

cmake ${source}/src/include \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${frontend_prefix}
make install

2) To build and install the reference threads backend:

cmake ${source}/src/reference_backends \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${backend_prefix} \
  -DTHREADS_BACKEND=On \
  -DDARMA_FRONTEND_DIR=${frontend_prefix}
make install

3) To build the examples against some installed backend:

If the backend provides a CMake package:

cmake ${source}/examples \
  -DDARMA_BACKEND_PKG=${backend_package_name} \
  -D${backend_package_name}_DIR=${backend_prefix}/cmake

For the threads backend, use backend_package_name=DarmaThreadsBackend above.

If the backend does not provide a CMake package:

cmake ${source}/examples \
  -DDARMA_FRONTEND_DIR=${frontend_prefix} \
  -DDARMA_BACKEND_DIR=${backend_prefix} \
  -DDARMA_BACKEND_LIBNAME=${backend_libname}

===========================================================================

The frontend and backend validation tests require the DEVELOPMENT version
of googletest/googlemock.  Release 1.7.0 is NOT sufficient.  Specify the
path to them to cmake using -DGTEST_DIR=.
